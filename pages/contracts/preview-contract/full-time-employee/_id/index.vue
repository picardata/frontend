              subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
              NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

            <p>
              <b>1.1. Statements of Work.</b> From time to time, Client and Contractor may execute
              one or more statement(s) of work, substantially in the form attached hereto as
              Exhibit A, detailing the specific services to be performed by Contractor (as
              executed, a <b>âStatement of Workâ</b>). Each Statement of Work will expressly refer to
              this Agreement, will form a part of this Agreement, and will be subject to the terms
              and conditions contained herein. A Statement of Work may be amended only by a
              signed (by each partyâs authorized signatory) and written agreement of the
              parties.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>1.2. Performance of Services.</b> Contractor will perform the services described in
              each Statement of Work (the <b>âServicesâ</b>) in accordance with the terms and
              conditions set forth in each Statement of Work and this Agreement. Unless
              otherwise agreed by Client, Contractor will determine, in Contractorâs sole
              discretion, the manner and means by which the Services are accomplished,
              subject to the requirement that Contractor will at all times comply with applicable
              law and any compliance policies drawn to Contractorsâ attention insofar as they
              are applicable to independent contractors.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>1.3. Equipment and Facilities.</b> Unless otherwise provided in a Statement of Work,
              Contractor will perform the Services at Contractorâs offices or facilities, using
              Contractorâs instruments, equipment and tools. Contractor will determine the time,
              place and order in which Contractor will perform the Services in accordance with
              any milestones and/or timeline set forth in a Statement of Work.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>1.4. Subcontractors.</b> Contractor may appoint a suitably skilled substitute in
              replacement of the initial personnel and shall be entitled to subcontract the
              performance of the Consultancy Services, provided that Client is satisfied that the
              sub-contractor possesses the necessary skills, expertise and resources to
              perform those elements of the Services and that Contractor ensures the
              substitute or subcontractor will abide by the same obligations Contractor is
              subject to under the terms of this Agreement regarding confidentiality, intellectual
              property, data protection, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-tax avoidance; if so
              required, Contractor will ensure that the subcontractor or substitute enters into
              direct undertakings with Contractor regarding these obligations. Contractor will
              continue to be bound by all the obligations in this Agreement and will invoice
              Client and be responsible for the remuneration of the substitute or subcontractor.
              Contractor will keep Client fully and effectively indemnified against any
              reasonable costs, claims or expenses that may be incurred by it as a result of the
              use of such subcontractors including the reasonable cost of all instruction
              (necessitated by the subcontracting) for the sub-contractor.
            </p>

              reimburse Contractor for reasonable travel and related expenses incurred in the
              course of performing the Services hereunder, provided, however, that any such
              expenses will be approved in advance in writing by Client. As a condition to
              receipt of reimbursement, Contractor will submit to Client reasonable evidence
              that the amount involved was both reasonable and necessary to the Services
              provided under this Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.3. Payment Terms.</b> The payment terms will be set forth in the Statement of
              Work. The parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to

            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.4.</b> Client acknowledges that Contractor has appointed Globelise Pte Ltd, a Singapore

              agent for the purpose of facilitating the receipt of payments made by Client for
              services provided in connection with this Agreement and each Statement of Work
              using a payment method supported by Globelise or by one of Globelise's Payment Service
              Providers, and the disbursement of those payments to Contractor.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.5.</b> Client agrees to make all payments to Contractor using one of the payment
              methods supported by the Globelise platform. Client and Contractor represent and
              warrant that they have carefully read, understood and accepted the Globelise
              platform terms and conditions (the <b>âGlobelise Terms and Conditionsâ</b>) available on
              the Globeliseâs website ( www.globelise.com/terms). In the event of any conflict
              between this Agreement and the Globelise Terms and Conditions, this Agreement will
              govern. Both parties acknowledge that acceptance of the Globelise Terms and
              Conditions by each party is a precondition to entering into this Agreement.

            <p><b>3. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES</b></p>

            <p>
              <b>3.1. Independent Contractor.</b> Contractorâs relationship with Client will be that of
              an independent contractor acting as a service provider to Client, and not that of
              an employee, worker, agent or partner of Client. Contractor will not be entitled to
              any statutory benefits payable to employees or workers by law, or otherwise any
              benefits paid or made available by Client to its employees or workers, including,
              without limitation, any retirement or pension benefits, Employment Insurance,
              Canada Pension Plan, or provincial parental insurance plan contributions;
              participation in any plans, arrangements or distributions made by Client pertaining
              to any bonus, stock options, profit sharing, insurance or similar benefits; or any
              other end-of-service benefits payable to an employee or worker.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>3.2. No Authority.</b> Contractor will have no authority to enter into agreements that
              bind Client or create obligations on the part of Client without the prior written
              authorization of Client. Contractor will not hold itself out as being an employee,
              agent, partner or assignee of Client, as having any authority to bind Client or to
              incur any liability on behalf of Client, and will make such absence of authority
              clear in its dealings with any third parties.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>3.3. Status.</b> This contract is one for the provision of services and not a contract of
              employment and accordingly, Contractor will be solely responsible for(a)
              payment of all taxes, salaries, benefits, Employment Insurance and provincial
              parental insurance premiums, Canada Pension Plan contributions, withholding
              taxes, workersâ compensation, and disability insurance, and any other liability,
              deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arising from or made in connection
              with the performance of the Services required by any government agency; and
              (b) compliance with all applicable labour and employment requirements with
              respect to Contractorâs self-employment, sole proprietorship or other form of
              business organization. Contractor will report to all applicable government
              agencies as income all compensation received by Client pursuant to this
              Agreement. Contractor will ensure that none of its employees hold themselves out
              as being the employees of Client or having any authority at any time to bind
              Client, or otherwise attempt to claim any employment or other relationship with
              Client.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>3.4. Liability.</b> Contractor will be liable for and will indemnify Client for any loss,
              liability, costs, (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and other
              professionals), penalties, damages and expenses arising from any breach of the
              terms of this Agreement and/or any applicable Statement of Work (including its
              data protection provisions) by Contractor or by a subcontractor engaged by
              Contractor of the terms of this Agreement (including in relation to data protection
              obligations) or any other action or inaction by or for or on behalf of Contractor.
              Contractor will accordingly maintain in force suitable insurance policies.
              Contractor acknowledges that Client will not carry any liability insurance on behalf
              of Contractor. Contractor will provide promptly copies of such insurance obtained
              on reasonable request.
            </p>

              <b>5.2. Economic Value of Confidential Information.</b> Contractor acknowledges that
              Confidential Information has independent economic value, actual or potential, that
              is not generally known to the public or to others who could obtain economic value
              from its disclosure or use, and that the Confidential Information is subject to a

              disclose any information pertaining to this Agreement, the terms of this
              Agreement, or any of the Confidential Information. Except as essential to
              Contractor's obligations pursuant to its relationship with Client, Contractor will not
              make any duplication or other copy of Clientâs Confidential Information.

              Information obtained or created pursuant to this Agreement, to any federal,
              provincial or local government body or agency, or to any other person or entity,
              public or private, without (i) express prior written permission of Client, or (ii) a
              court or administrative order requiring disclosure. In the event that Contractor
              forms the opinion that it is required by applicable law to disclose any of Clientâs
              Confidential Information, or is served with a witness summons, subpoena, or court
              or administrative order requiring disclosure of any Confidential Information,
              Contractor will, prior to making such disclosure, immediately notify Client in
              writing, and will, in accordance with Clientâs direction, respond, appeal or
              challenge such witness summons, subpoena, or court administrative order, prior

              challenging any such witness summons, subpoena, or court or administrative
              order; except that this Section 5.3 will not apply where Contractor is required by
              law to disclose Clientâs Confidential Information without notice to Client. Neither
              Contractor nor Contractorâs related entities, or subcontractors, nor their
              respective employees will disclose any Confidential Information to any third party,
              nor will they use or allow the use of any Confidential Information, to further any
              private interest other than as contemplated by this Agreement. Contractor will
              take appropriate measures to ensure the confidentiality and protection of all
              Confidential Information and to prevent its disclosure or its inappropriate use by
              Contractor or its subcontractors, or by Contractorâs or its subcontractorsâ
              respective employees or related entities. Contractorâs obligations under this

              indemnify Client and hold it harmless from and against all claims, liabilities,

              prior written consent. Any attempt by Contractor to assign or transfer this

              by law, without having to post a bond or other consideration, in addition to all
              other remedies that Client may have for a breach of this Agreement at law or
              otherwise.

            <p>
              <b>10.6. Severability.</b> If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
              unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of

              Agreement (including any Statement of Work). No term of any Statement of Work
              will be deemed to amend the terms of this Agreement unless a Statement of Work
              references a specific provision in this Agreement and provides that the Statement
              of Work is amending only that specific provision of this Agreement and only with
              respect to Services performed pursuant to such Statement of Work. Any waiver,
              modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement will be effective

              the same instrument.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>10.12. Modifications.</b> This Agreement may be modified only by a contract in

              CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT
            </h3>

            <p>This Contractor Agreement <b>(âAgreementâ)</b> is entered into as of {{ currentDate }} (the <b>âEffective Dateâ</b>), between:</p>

            <p>
              {{ company.name }}, Incorporation having its principal place of business at {{ company.street }} {{ company.city }} {{ company.postalCode }}, email address: <b>(âClientâ)</b>, and
              [Contractor name], having its principal place of business at [street address, city,
              state, zip], registered under the number [Registration Number] and email
              address: [email], <b>(âContractorâ)</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Client and Contractor desire to have Contractor perform services for Client,
              subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
              NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
            </p>

            <p><b>1. SERVICES</b></p>
            <p>
              <b>1.1. Statements of Work.</b> From time to time, Client and Contractor may execute
              one or more statement(s) of work, substantially in the form attached hereto as
              Exhibit A, detailing the specific services to be performed by Contractor (as
              executed, a <b>âStatement of Workâ</b>). Each Statement of Work will expressly refer to
              this Agreement, will form a part of this Agreement, and will be subject to the terms
              and conditions contained herein. A Statement of Work may be amended only by a
              signed (by each partyâs authorized signatory) and written agreement of the
              parties.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>1.2. Performance of Services.</b> Contractor will perform the services described in
              each Statement of Work (the <b>âServicesâ</b>) in accordance with the terms and
              conditions set forth in each Statement of Work and this Agreement. Unless
              otherwise agreed by Client, Contractor will determine, in Contractorâs sole
              discretion, the manner and means by which the Services are accomplished,
              subject to the requirement that Contractor will at all times comply with applicable
              law and any compliance policies drawn to Contractorsâ attention insofar as they
              are applicable to independent contractors.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>1.3. Equipment and Facilities.</b> Unless otherwise provided in a Statement of Work,
              Contractor will perform the Services at Contractorâs offices or facilities, using
              Contractorâs instruments, equipment and tools. Contractor will determine the time,
              place and order in which Contractor will perform the Services in accordance with
              any milestones and/or timeline set forth in a Statement of Work.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>1.4. Subcontractors.</b> Contractor may appoint a suitably skilled substitute in
              replacement of the initial personnel and shall be entitled to subcontract the
              performance of the Consultancy Services, provided that Client is satisfied that the
              sub-contractor possesses the necessary skills, expertise and resources to
              perform those elements of the Services and that Contractor ensures the
              substitute or subcontractor will abide by the same obligations Contractor is
              subject to under the terms of this Agreement regarding confidentiality, intellectual
              property, data protection, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-tax avoidance; if so
              required, Contractor will ensure that the subcontractor or substitute enters into
              direct undertakings with Contractor regarding these obligations. Contractor will
              continue to be bound by all the obligations in this Agreement and will invoice
              Client and be responsible for the remuneration of the substitute or subcontractor.
              Contractor will keep Client fully and effectively indemnified against any
              reasonable costs, claims or expenses that may be incurred by it as a result of the
              use of such subcontractors including the reasonable cost of all instruction
              (necessitated by the subcontracting) for the sub-contractor.
            </p>

            <p><b>2. PAYMENT</b></p>

            <p>
              <b>2.1. Fees.</b> As Contractorâs sole compensation for the performance of Services,
              Client will pay Contractor the fees specified in each Statement of Work in
              accordance with the terms set forth therein. Contractor acknowledges and
              agrees that, if specified in a Statement of Work, Clientâs payment obligation will be
              expressly subject to Contractorâs completion of Services provided therein or
              achievement of certain milestones to Clientâs reasonable satisfaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.2. Expenses.</b> Unless otherwise provided in the Statement of Work, Client will
              reimburse Contractor for reasonable travel and related expenses incurred in the
              course of performing the Services hereunder, provided, however, that any such
              expenses will be approved in advance in writing by Client. As a condition to
              receipt of reimbursement, Contractor will submit to Client reasonable evidence
              that the amount involved was both reasonable and necessary to the Services
              provided under this Agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.3. Payment Terms.</b> The payment terms will be set forth in the Statement of
              Work. The parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
              promptly resolve any payment disputes.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.4.</b> Client acknowledges that Contractor has appointed Globelise Pte Ltd, a Singapore
              registered company as Contractor's limited payment
              agent for the purpose of facilitating the receipt of payments made by Client for
              services provided in connection with this Agreement and each Statement of Work
              using a payment method supported by Globelise or by one of Globelise's Payment Service
              Providers, and the disbursement of those payments to Contractor.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>2.5.</b> Client agrees to make all payments to Contractor using one of the payment
              methods supported by the Globelise platform. Client and Contractor represent and
              warrant that they have carefully read, understood and accepted the Globelise
              platform terms and conditions (the <b>âGlobelise Terms and Conditionsâ</b>) available on
              the Globeliseâs website ( www.globelise.com/terms). In the event of any conflict
              between this Agreement and the Globelise Terms and Conditions, this Agreement will
              govern. Both parties acknowledge that acceptance of the Globelise Terms and
              Conditions by each party is a precondition to entering into this Agreement.
              Client will collect and process Contractorâs Personal Data in accordance with its
              privacy notice and applicable laws.
            </p>

            <p><b>3. RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES</b></p>

            <p>
              <b>3.1. Independent Contractor.</b> Contractorâs relationship with Client will be that of
              an independent contractor acting as a service provider to Client, and not that of
              an employee, worker, agent or partner of Client. Contractor will not be entitled to
              any statutory benefits payable to employees or workers by law, or otherwise any
              benefits paid or made available by Client to its employees or workers, including,
              without limitation, any retirement or pension benefits, Employment Insurance,
              Canada Pension Plan, or provincial parental insurance plan contributions;
              participation in any plans, arrangements or distributions made by Client pertaining
              to any bonus, stock options, profit sharing, insurance or similar benefits; or any
              other end-of-service benefits payable to an employee or worker.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>3.2. No Authority.</b> Contractor will have no authority to enter into agreements that
              bind Client or create obligations on the part of Client without the prior written
              authorization of Client. Contractor will not hold itself out as being an employee,
              agent, partner or assignee of Client, as having any authority to bind Client or to
              incur any liability on behalf of Client, and will make such absence of authority
              clear in its dealings with any third parties.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>3.3. Status.</b> This contract is one for the provision of services and not a contract of
              employment and accordingly, Contractor will be solely responsible for(a)
              payment of all taxes, salaries, benefits, Employment Insurance and provincial
              parental insurance premiums, Canada Pension Plan contributions, withholding
              taxes, workersâ compensation, and disability insurance, and any other liability,
              deduction, contribution, assessment or claim arising from or made in connection
              with the performance of the Services required by any government agency; and
              (b) compliance with all applicable labour and employment requirements with
              respect to Contractorâs self-employment, sole proprietorship or other form of
              business organization. Contractor will report to all applicable government
              agencies as income all compensation received by Client pursuant to this
              Agreement. Contractor will ensure that none of its employees hold themselves out

              order; except that this Section 5.3 will not apply where Contractor is required by
